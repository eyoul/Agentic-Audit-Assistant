# Getting Ready: Free LLM Options for This Course

In this course, you’ll be using tools like **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to build intelligent, goal-driven AI systems. Many lessons include examples that use OpenAI’s API — a popular option, but one that typically requires a paid subscription.

**Good news:** you can complete this course **without needing to pay for API access**.

We’ve intentionally designed the curriculum with **low usage requirements**, so learners can follow along without hitting paywalls. All major projects and hands-on lessons can be completed using **free-tier API keys** or **local models** that run entirely on your machine.

In this lesson, you’ll learn about two ways to get started without spending anything:

1.  **Use Free API Access**
    Providers like **Groq** and **Google Gemini** offer generous free usage quotas for high-quality LLMs. Some of these even support OpenAI models, so you can stick with familiar prompts while avoiding upfront costs.

2.  **Run Local Models with Ollama**
    If you have a machine with a decent GPU, you can use **Ollama** to download and run open-source models like **Llama 3**, **Mistral**, or **Code Llama** right on your computer. This option gives you full control and zero API limits — perfect for hands-on learners who want to explore under the hood.

We’ll walk you through how to set up each of these options and explain the tradeoffs — from speed and quality to installation complexity and system requirements.

 # Option 2: Run a Local LLM with Ollama
 
 Don’t want to depend on cloud APIs at all? **Ollama** lets you run powerful LLMs like **Llama 3**, **Mistral**, and **Code Llama** locally — with no API keys, no rate limits, and no internet required once models are downloaded.
 
 This is a great option if:
 
 * You want full control over the models you're using
 * You’re interested in exploring open models
 * You have a machine with enough resources (RAM and GPU)
 
 > ⚠️ Running local models requires decent hardware — especially if you're using larger models. We recommend starting with smaller variants like `llama3-8b-8192` if you’re unsure.
 
 ---
 
 ## Advantages of Using Ollama
 
 * ✅ **No API calls or rate limits** — everything runs locally
 * ✅ **Fully offline** after initial model download
 * ✅ **Free and open-source** — no subscriptions or tokens needed
 * ✅ **Great for privacy-conscious development and experimentation**
 * ✅ **LangChain-compatible** with minimal setup
 
 ---
 
 <!-- RT_DIVIDER -->
 
 ## What Your System Needs
 
 Going local with Ollama gives you full control and unlimited usage — but it also demands serious memory. Here’s how to figure out if your hardware can handle it.
 
 ---
 
 <h3> Memory Rule (Assuming FP32) </h3>
 
 Let’s assume you’re running the model using standard **FP32** precision — that means each parameter (or weight) uses **4 bytes** of memory.
 
 > **Memory required (in GB)** =
 > `Model size in billions × 4`
 
 💡 Here, “model size” refers to the **number of parameters** (also called weights or hyperparameters), typically expressed in billions (e.g., 7B, 13B, 70B).
 
 So for example:
 
 * A **7B** model in **FP32** requires `7 × 4 = 28 GB`
 * A **13B** model in **FP32** requires `13 × 4 = 52 GB`
 
 Most laptop GPUs can’t handle this — but don’t worry, there’s a trick.
 
 ---
 
 <h3> But You Can Use Less: Enter Quantization </h3>
 
 Most models don’t need full 32-bit precision to run effectively. You can use **quantization** — a technique that stores each parameter in fewer bits.
 
 This significantly reduces memory usage while keeping model quality high enough for most tasks.
 
 | Precision Type | Bytes per Parameter | Notes                       |
 | -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
 | FP32           | 4                   | Full precision              |
 | FP16           | 2                   | Common for inference        |
 | Q8             | 1                   | 8-bit quantization          |
 | Q4             | 0.5                 | 4-bit quantization (common) |
 
 
 :::tip{title="Info"}
 💡 Note: Lower precision (like FP16, Q8, Q4) is commonly used for inference to save memory, while training usually requires higher precision like FP32 or FP16 to maintain accuracy and stability.
 :::
 
 ---
 
 <h3> Memory Formula with Quantization </h3>
 
 > **Memory required (in GB)** =
 > `Model size in billions × bytes per parameter`
 
 **Examples:**
 
 * A **7B** model in **Q4** → `7 × 0.5 = 3.5 GB`
 * A **13B** model in **FP16** → `13 × 2 = 26 GB`
 
 That’s why tools like **Ollama** can run quantized models on machines with as little as 8–16 GB of GPU memory.
 
 ---
 
 <h3> Memory Requirements by Model Size </h3>
 
 | Model Size | FP32 (4 bytes) | FP16 (2 bytes) | Q8 (1 byte) | Q4 (0.5 byte) |
 | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
 | 1B         | 4 GB           | 2 GB           | 1 GB        | 0.5 GB        |
 | 3B         | 12 GB          | 6 GB           | 3 GB        | 1.5 GB        |
 | 7B         | 28 GB          | 14 GB          | 7 GB        | 3.5 GB        |
 | 8B         | 32 GB          | 16 GB          | 8 GB        | 4 GB          |
 | 13B        | 52 GB          | 26 GB          | 13 GB       | 6.5 GB        |
 | 20B        | 80 GB          | 40 GB          | 20 GB       | 10 GB         |
 | 30B        | 120 GB         | 60 GB          | 30 GB       | 15 GB         |
 | 65B        | 260 GB         | 130 GB         | 65 GB       | 32.5 GB       |
 | 70B        | 280 GB         | 140 GB         | 70 GB       | 35 GB         |
 | 120B        | 480 GB         | 240 GB         | 120 GB       | 60 GB         |

 <h3> Reality Check: Don't Forget Overhead </h3>
 
 The values above only account for **model weights**. But during inference, your system also needs memory for:
 
 * **Activations** (intermediate outputs at each layer)
 * **Input tokens**
 * **Temporary buffers**
 
 A safe rule of thumb:
 
 > Add **20–50% extra memory** on top of the base estimate to avoid out-of-memory errors.
 
 ---
 
 <h3> What Will Run on a Laptop GPU? </h3>
 
 * **8 GB GPU** → you’ll likely need to stick with **1B–3B models** in **Q4**
 * **16 GB GPU** → you might be able to run a **7B model** in **Q4 or Q8**
 * **32 GB+ GPU** → capable of running **13B+ models**, especially in FP16
 
 > 🔧 For comparison: An **NVIDIA A100 (40 GB variant)** can run a **13B model in FP16** or a **30B model in Q4**. To run **70B models**, you'd need **multiple high-end GPUs** or advanced memory management.

 # OpenAI's GPT-OSS Models: Now Available for Local Use
 
 OpenAI recently released open-source versions of their models, known as **GPT-OSS**. These include two models like **gpt-oss-20b** and **gpt-oss-120b** that you can now run locally using Ollama.
 
 **What makes GPT-OSS special:**
 - **Fully open-weight** - you can download and modify them freely
 - **High performance** - built on OpenAI's latest architecture
 - **Local deployment** - run them on your own hardware with Ollama
 
 **Using GPT-OSS with Ollama:**
 ```bash
 # Download the 20B model (requires ~16GB RAM)
 ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
 
 # Or the larger 120B model (requires ~60GB RAM)
 ollama pull gpt-oss:120b
 ```
 
 **Reality check:** While these models offer cutting-edge capabilities, they require substantial hardware resources that are likely beyond most learning setups. The 20B model needs around 16GB of RAM, and the 120B model needs approximately 60GB - making cloud APIs more practical for most users in this course.
 
 However, if you have access to high-end workstations or servers, these models represent an exciting opportunity to run OpenAI-quality models completely locally and privately.
